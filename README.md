# YouMask

A simple *NIX mask calculator for Windows. 

Getting the right octal mask for permissions on any *NIX system was always annoying for me, I decided to write a 
simple calculator to get immediately a visual representation from a mask and be able to create a mask with a few checkboxes clicks.

## Requirements

Something that runs a .NET framework implementation with a working _System.Windows.Forms_ namespace.

Official .NET of course or Mono (I think) should do the trick. The VS2012 project targets .NET 4.0 Client Profile.
